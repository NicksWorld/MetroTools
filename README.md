# MetroTools

Used to be my sandbox on reverse-engineering Metro game formats (starting from 2033 and up to Exodus), some apps for simple "modding", and so on.
Pretty useless nowadays since you can just grab the official Exodus SDK (https://exodus-sdk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESDK/overview?homepageId=1714585601)

Anyways, now it's public for posterity. And I have no hobby anymore :'(
