0. What's up?
=============

MultiToolBox is a toolbox a la widget box in Qt Designer. It can contain
arbitrary widgets (no need to derive them from some weird class).

1. What's wrong with QToolBox?
==============================
Only one (current) tool widget is visible (it's by design).

2. License.
===============
MultiToolBox is a free software, it's distributed under the terms of
the WTFPLv2 license. See the COPYING file for more details.

3. Compilation.
===============
Copy the multitoolbox directory into your project and 

include(multitoolbox/multitoolbox.pri)

into your *.pro file.

4. Usage.
===============
Use the

void MultiToolBox::addWidget(QWidget* w, bool visible = true);

method to add a widget into the toolbox. Please note: MultiToolBox takes
the ownership of the widget, so if you need to directly use that widget
(i.e. call methods via pointer, as opposed to signal/slot mechanism) you'd
better wrap into QPointer and check if it's !isNull().

Use the

QList<QPointer<QWidget> > MultiToolBox::widgets() const;

to find out which widgets are managed by the toolbox.

Removing widgets from the MultiToolBox is not supported at this time.
